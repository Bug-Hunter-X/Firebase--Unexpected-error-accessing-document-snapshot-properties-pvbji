The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the `snapshot.exists` check. This often leads to unexpected behavior, particularly when handling asynchronous operations. For example, if you try to access `snapshot.data().name` without checking if `snapshot.exists` is true, you will get an error if the document doesn't exist.
